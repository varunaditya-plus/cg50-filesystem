# File system demo (for the fx-CG50)

Thijs project is a **demonstration of how to access the filesystem** using C and fxsdk for a fx-CG50 add-in.

Personally I found it extremely hard to find any sort of gint documentation being new to C, and when trying to access the filesystem for score saving, I had some issues. If you're having similar issues with gint, this project will probably help you out.
